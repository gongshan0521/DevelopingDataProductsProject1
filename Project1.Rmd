## Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(leaflet)

my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-79.958657, lat=40.443958, popup = "Where I am Studying the Course!")
my_map
```
